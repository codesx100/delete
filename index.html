	<p> Hi welcome to my first webpage that I actually programmed using HTML and CSS to format and look the way it is. Anyway currently I work and live in NJ and is currently beginning to study Information Systems in hopes for a master degree. I am hoping that pursuing this degree will better enable me in the field of IS and be a great complement to my bachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering technology. With this degree I hope that it not only can teach me many new things in a different field but also advance my position at my job one day at Celgene in possibly a different department. My background with internet technologies goes more along with more of the hardware and how networks work from learning ECET.</p>
	
	<p> Currently I am working at Celgene Corporation in New Jersey as a building systems managment technician, there I work on Honeywell and Siemens communication panels which monitor devices that are used in their labs. We also use Allen Bradley PLCs to control air handlers for the different buildings on each site. My work requires working with our IT department thus I wanted to pursue a degree in information systems.  Having that master's degree and being in information systems will greatly help accerlate my career and open up many new opportunites for my future. My goal both academically and professionally is to enable myself to learn many different fields in the technology world as it is always growing at a very rapid rate</p>
	
	<p> Lastly both my ECET degree and everything I learn from my IS degree are more than just advancing myself in my career, it reaches out to my personal life and many of my hobbies. Being able to design websites as a cause of IS601 will help greatly possibly with a side job helping some individuals that may want a web desinger for some of their small businesses and products to get out there on the internet. My ECET degree already is proof that this is possible, one of my major hobbies is speakers and home theater some of it is design of speakers and other times it is knowing what to look for when going to purchase speakers or other electronic devices. </p>
	
	<P> In the end I hope that this gave you a quick overview of me, I want to thank you for visitng this site, and learning a bit about me! </p>
