				  	<p> Hi welcome to my first webpage that I actually programmed using HTML and CSS to format. Currently I work and live in NJ and beginning to study Information Systems in hopes for a master degree. I am hoping that pursuing this degree will better enable me in the field of I.S. and be a great complement to my bachelor's degree in electrical and computer engineering technology. With this degree I hope that it will teach me many new things as it is a different field but also advance my position at Celgene. My background with internet technologies goes more along with more of the hardware and how networks work from learning ECET, which also helps in relation to persuing this degree.</p>
						
					<p> Currently I am working at Celgene Corporation in New Jersey as a building systems managment technician, there I work on Honeywell and Siemens communication panels which monitor devices that are used on their sites. We also use Allen Bradley PLCs to control air handlers for the different buildings. My work requires working with our IT department thus I wanted to pursue a degree in information systems.  Getting s master's degree in information systems will help greatly accerlate my career and open up many new opportunites for my future. My goal both academically and professionally is to enable myself to learn many different fields in the technology world as it is always growing and is a major need.</p>
								
					<p>Lastly both my ECET degree and everything I learn from my I.S. degree are more than just advancing myself in my career, it reaches out to my personal life and many of my hobbies.Being able to design websites as a cause of IS601 will help greatly possibly with a side jobs and hobbies helping some individuals that may want a web designer for some of their small businesses. My ECET degree already is proof that this is possible, one of my major hobbies is speakers and home theater some of it deals with design of speakers and other times it is knowing what to look for when going to purchase speakers or other electronic devices.	</p>
										
					<P>In the end I hope that this gave you a quick overview of me, I want to thank you for visitng this site, and learning a bit about me!	</p>
